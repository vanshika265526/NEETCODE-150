# SEARCHING:
1. Linear Search- Case	    Time     Space
                  Best	    O(1)      O(1)
                  Average	  O(n)      O(1)
                  Worst	    O(n)      O(1)

2. Binary Search- Case	     Time       Space(Iterative)   (Recursive)
                  Best	     O(1)        O(1)               O(1)
                  Average    O(log n)    O(1)               O(log n)
                  Worst	     O(log n)    O(1)               O(log n)
In the iterative approach, binary search uses a loop and only a fixed number of variables like left, right, and mid.
So, it requires constant extra space, i.e., O(1). 
In the recursive approach, each function call is stored in the call stack.
Since binary search makes log n recursive calls, the space required by the call stack is O(log n
